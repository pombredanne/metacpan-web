                    <p>Bytemark Hosting is the UK's "geek hosting outfit of choice" because its programmer &amp; network-engineer team have built it that way since 2002, with their own tools, software and technical expertise. They understand web applications and network infrastructure equally, and host names such as Bostik, dopplr.com and Britain's largest mystery shopping company, Retail Eyes. Their hosting starts at only £15 per month and runs to multi-site managed setups for customers with the fussiest demands of reliability and failover.</p>
